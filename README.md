# C++ Basics and Algorithms

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs designed for learning and practicing C++ programming concepts. It covers:
- ✅ **Basic operations:** Mathematical operations, type conversions, and string manipulations.
- ✅ **OOP Concepts:** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- ✅ **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, and string operations.
- ✅ **Practical Applications:** Hospital billing system, student score calculation, and bank operations.

## 📁 **Directory Structure**
- `basic_programs`: Fundamental programs (e.g., even/odd, prime checkers, and factorial).
- `oop_programs`: Programs demonstrating classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- `math_operations`: Programs for mathematical operations like Fibonacci, sum of divisors, and Armstrong numbers.
- `practical_apps`: Business management systems, hospital bills, and bank simulations.
- `algorithms`: Array operations, string manipulation, and sorting algorithms.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- C++ (Standard Libraries: `iostream`, `string`, `vector`, `cmath`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- STL (Standard Template Library)

## 📝 **Usage**
To compile and run a program:
```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output_name>
./<output_name>
```
For example:
```bash
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
./factorial
```
